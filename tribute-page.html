    <h2>Life of Eminem</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong style="color: red">1972</strong> - He was born Marshall Bruce Mathers III in Saint Joseph, Missouri to Deborah R. Nelson Mathers-Briggs and Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">1989</strong> - Since he turned 14, Eminem had started showing interest in hip-hop and rap and had joined the group "Bassmint Productions`` under the name M&M. Due to excessive truancy and failing and re-taking Grade 9 twice, he decided he had had enough and dropped out of high school in 1989.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">1996</strong> - Eminem`s first full studio album, Infinite, was released under the label Web Entertainment. The album performed poorly on the charts, but Eminem didn`t let that faze him. His next album would launch him to superstar status.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">1998</strong> - Releases his second album The Slim Shady LP. After being signed to Aftermath Entertainment/Interscope Records in 1998, Eminem released the Slim Shady LP which was met with huge success, due to Dr.Dre supporting Eminem so much. It has sold over 5 million copies in the US alone and has been certified 4x platinum.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2000</strong> - Releases third album The Marshall Mathers LP and in its first week it sells 1.76 million copies. His third studio album, the Marshall Mathers LP was even more successful than the Slim Shady LP. It has sold over 25 million worldwide and has been certified diamond in the US. The album one Best Rap Album in the 2000 Grammy Awards.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2002</strong> - 8 mile is sort of a semi-biography, loosely based on Eminem`s life, but the plot involves fictional characters. Eminem stars as JImmy `B-Rabbit` Smith Jr. B-Rabbit, like how Eminem was, is an aspiring rapper and faces many conflicts and betrayals throughout the movie before reaching his goal. The movies was both a critical and commercial success and was nominated for many awards. It won an Academy Award for Best Original Song, Eminem's "Lose Yourself".</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2004</strong> - Eminem's fifth abum did very well, but did not perform as well as his older ones. Fans and critics also stated that the lyrics were subpar compared to older albums, but that didn't stop the album from selling 1.5 million copies in its first two weeks of release.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2005</strong> - Before the release of his fifth studio album, Curtain Call: The Hits (a compliation of all his hits) there had been much speculation if Eminem was considering retirement. After the release of the album, which has been certified 2x platinum, Eminem took a break from music and fans did not know if he would return.......</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2007</strong> - During an interview with 50 Cent at a New York radio station, Eminem called in and stated that he's popping in and out of the studio but doesn't feel commited to an album yet. In December 2008, he confirmed the existance of a new Eminem album and that most of the production would be done by Dr. Dre.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2009</strong> - His first original album since Encore in 2004, Relapse performed reasonably well, but was not a huge success compared to the Marshall Mathers LP, the Slim Shady LP etc. It has been cetified 2x platinum.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2010</strong> - Recovery was met with exceptional sales and is more emotional and lyrical than Relapse. It is Eminem's latest album and has some very popular singles, such as "Not Afraid" and "Love the Way You Lie". The album has sold 5.4 million copies worldwide. On October 5 Eminem released a seperate single "No Love", featuring Lil' Wayne.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2013</strong> - Eminem released his eighth album, MMLP2, on November 5, 2013. The announcement for the future Grammy-winning album, formally titled The Marshall Mathers LP 2, was made during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. 

On the awards show, Eminem leaked a snippet of the first single from the album, entitled "Berzerk." He went to reach of the top of charts with "The Monster," a track that also featured Rihanna and earned a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2014</strong> - In 2014, Eminem celebrated the 15th anniversary of his Shady Records label with a special two-CD set called ShadyXV. The collection features the label's most popular songs as well as some new material. The single "Guts Over Fear" quickly rose up the charts after its late October debut.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2017</strong> - At the end of 2017, Eminem released his ninth studio album, Revival. Its first two singles, "Walk on Water" and "River," featured collaborations with pop superstars Beyoncé and Ed Sheeran.

The album as a whole divided critics and failed to garner the accolades notched by his previous efforts. None of the songs reached the Top 10 on the Billboard 100, while each of his three previous albums resulted in at least one No. 1 hit.</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2018</strong> - While nearly four years passed between Eminem's eighth and ninth albums, fans only had to wait a few months before he dropped his next studio effort, Kamikaze, on August 31, 2018. 

The surprise album kicked off with "Ringer," which featured the rapper diving right back into his disdain for President Donald Trump. In October 2017, Eminem had made headlines for a freestyle segment taped for the BET Hip Hop Awards, in which he ripped into Trump. 

The single "Not Alike" attacked rapper Machine Gun Kelly, known as MGK, for lewd comments he had made several years before about Eminem's then-underage daughter, Hailie. After MGK replied with the track "Rap Devil," Eminem followed up with the single "Killshot," a barrage of insults about MGK's talents and lack of success, which shot to number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The album helped Eminem rebound from Revival. However, beyond the album's successes, Eminem was criticized for homophobic insults on the tracks "Killshot" and "Fall."</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">2020</strong> - As with Kamikaze, Eminem dropped Music to Be Murdered By with no advance warning in January 2020. The 20-track album was accompanied by the release of a video for "Darkness," which recalled the deadly mass shooting at the 2017 Route 91 Harvest music festival in Las Vegas and urged viewers to vote to change gun laws.

The following month, the rapper made a surprise appearance at the Academy Awards to perform his winner from the 2003 ceremony, "Lose Yourself."</li><br>
      <li><strong style="color: red">Lesser known fact</strong> - Thanks to the song by Eminem, the word "stan" is added to the Oxford American Dictionary, defined as "an overzealous or obsessive fan of a particular celebrity."</li><br>
